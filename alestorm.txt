Piracy's a crime and crime doesn't pay
And we go home poor at the end of the day
But I'd rather live my life in rags
Than be chained to a desk with a wife that's a hag

We live each day like there's nothing to lose
But a man has needs and that need is booze
They say all the best things in life are free
So give all your beer and your rum to me

We are here to drink your beer
And steal your rum at the point of a gun
Your alcohol to us will fall
'Cause we are here to drink your beer

We've sailed over seas for Wenches and Mead
And told great tales of The Huntmaster's deeds
The quest for a drop of the Famous ol' Spiced
Has shown us the wrath of Leviathan's bites

We went Back Through Time to get more Rum
Though we end up Shipwrecked having no fun
But Heavy Metal Pirates we must be
So give all your beer and your rum to me

We are here to drink your beer
And steal your rum at the point of a gun
Your alcohol to us will fall
'Cause we are here to drink your beer

Go! A storm is coming
The cold is mind numbing
Darkness is descending
Die, there's no escaping
We're all anticipating
Smashing your brains tonight

Firing the cannons and raising the flag
This is the piratical way
We under the sign of the Storm of Ale
Soon with your lives you will pay

Go! We're losing our minds
Into the barrel, and drink what we find

Rum, beer, quests and mead
These are the things that a pirate needs
Raise the flag and let's set sail
Under the sign of the Storm of Ale

Rum, the finest potion
It gives me quite the notion
To vomit over your face
Beer, so cold as ice
Its taste it will suffice
Drinking through night and through day

Quest! This is the meaning of life
A voyage into the unknown
A tankard of mead, is all that I need
To enter the partying zone

Go! We're out of control
Escape from your brain to the depths of your soul

Rum, beer, quests and mead
These are the things that a pirate needs
Raise the flag and let's set sail
Under the sign of the Storm of Ale

Go! We're losing our minds
Into the barrel, and drink what we find
Go! There's no turning back
Ready for battle, it's time to attack

Rum, beer, quests and mead
These are the things that a pirate needs
Raise the flag and let's set sail
Under the sign of the Storm of Ale

Many moons ago, in a faraway land
We met an old man with a hook for a hand
He showed us a map that lead to treasure untold
He said, "I'll give ye the map, if ye give me some gold"

For some pieces of eight the deal was done
He gave us the map, our quest had begun
We gathered our crew and set sail on the waves
And we knew we'd be rich by the end of the day

Now we're sailing over oceans and seas
With a lust for gold and the power of steel

Over the seas, we shall ride
Searching for treasure, into the night
Over the seas, our quest has begun
And we will not stop with the dawn of the sun

Through treacherous seas we reached the lost isle
And over it's shores we marched for many miles
Until we discovered where the treasure did lie
With gold coins and jewels gleaming inside

Now we're sailing over oceans and seas
With a lust for gold and the power of steel

Over the seas, we shall ride
Searching for treasure, into the night
Over the seas, our quest has begun
And we will not stop with the dawn of the sun

Over the seas, we shall ride
Searching for treasure, into the night
Over the seas, our quest is done

And we will be home by the dawn of the sun

Countless years ago while lost in barren seas
There whispered murmurs of a bloody mutiny
We took up arms and slain the officers of rank
And with swords drawn made the captain walk the plank

And as he fell down to the depths
He swore a deadly curse
"As sure as hell's my final fate
You'll all soon die, or worse"
Now as we stand before the gallows
Waiting for the end
I'll say these final words my friend

At sunrise we'll all dance the hempen jig
So raise up your pint of rum and take another swig
The curse of Captain Morgan has led us to this fate
So have no fear, and don't look back, the afterlife awaits

We returned to port with sorrow in our chests
An evil shadow followed us on every quest
Never to feel joy again was our fate
Only misery and death, fear and burning hate

We broke the law, betrayed the code
Now time is running out
An unforgivable offense
Of that there is no doubt
Now as we stand before the gallows
Waiting for the end
I'll say these final words my friend

At sunrise we'll all dance the hempen jig
So raise up your pint of rum and take another swig
The curse of Captain Morgan has led us to this fate
So have no fear, and don't look back, the afterlife awaits

Many years have passed now
Yet the curse still lives on
And now we rot in a black prison cell
Waiting for our true calling in hell

But for the lives we leave behind
Don't shed a tear, don't cry
The only way to break this curse
Is for us all to die
Now as we stand before the gallows
Waiting for the end
I'll say these final words my friend

At sunrise we'll all dance the hempen jig
So raise up your pint of rum and take another swig
The curse of Captain Morgan has led us to this fate
So have no fear, and don't look back, the afterlife awaits

At sunrise we'll all dance the hempen jig
So raise up your pint of rum and take another swig
The curse of Captain Morgan has led us to this fate
So have no fear, and don't look back, the afterlife awaits

In a time when men knew the meaning of fear
And the tyrants of hell ruled the land and the seas
There lived one man who was true
Guardian of secrets that only he knew
Condemned for a crime that he did not commit
Sentenced to die in the depths of the pit
He swore he would take his revenge
Every laster traitor, their lives he would end

With the power of ale - He could not fail

Sail into battle, glory and metal

Hail! - Huntmaster
Ride! - Huntmaster
Fight! - Huntmaster
Die! - Huntmaster

Up from the bowels of hell he sailed
Wielding a tankard of freshly brewed ale
Slaying all those in his path
Those who might hinder his god-given task
To bring back beer to the lands of the free
This is his quest, his true destiny
Legends shall speak of his name
Hail the Huntmaster, with honour and fame

With the power of ale - He could not fail

Sail into battle, glory and metal

Hail! - Huntmaster
Ride! - Huntmaster
Fight! - Huntmaster
Die! - Huntmaster

This is the hunter's badge of glory
That he protects and tends his quarry
Hunts with honor, as is due
And through the beast to the Gods is true

500 years ago when I was born
I crawled from the womb with a drinking horn
I held it to the sky in my tiny metal hand
And got real drunk before I could stand

Where you can get some mighty fine beer

It's the greatest damn place in the whole of the city

Cutthroats and lowlifes and worse I should dare

And all of our fears will be gone till tomorrow

First light reflects off the ocean
All crew now set into motion
Another day like many before it
Hard life, no way to ignore it
Behold! A cry from the crow's nest
A ship appears from the south west
The years below deck that bored me
All lead to what lies before me

Hear the terror - Fires burn and cannons sound
Fate awaits me - As the vessels circle round
See the slaughter - Cutlass swings and pistols fire
Feel the anger - Raging through my body tires
One last battle - In this sailor's lonely war
Come to meet this - Destiny I can't ignore
I hold my breath - Close my eyes and hang on for
Death before the mast

Too late to lay low or outrun
Up close we're outmanned and outgunned
Prepare to rush forth, unleash hel
Cross swords in one final farewell
Hulls crash, our vessel is boarded
No mercy or tact is afforded
But now the King's men draw closer
Seems like it may all be over

Hear the terror - Fires burn and cannons sound
Fate awaits me - As the vessels circle round
See the slaughter - Cutlass swings and pistols fire
Feel the anger - Raging through my body tires
One last battle - In this sailor's lonely war
Come to meet this - Destiny I can't ignore
I hold my breath - Close my eyes and hang on for
Death before the mast

A ship approaches off the starboard bow
The time has come to fight, the time to strike is now
Reload the cannons, and sharpen up your swords
They will regret the day they faced the pirate horde

Who will survive no-one can tell
Come on, lets give 'em hell

Terror on the High Seas
Terror on the High Seas

A flash of thunder lights up the midnight sky
Fifty dead across the deck as the ships draw side by side
Raise up your cutlasses and quest into the fight
A reign of terror we shall bring unto our foes this night

Who will survive no-one can tell
Come on, lets give 'em hell!

Terror on the High Seas
Terror on the High Seas
A reign of terror on the seas
We'll bring these poseurs to their knees

And now the time has come to die
Your destiny is nigh

We set sail at first light
Questing for steel with power and might
For countless days we ride the waves
The battle lies ahead
Our coming they do dread
We raise the black flag
And ready our attack

Fire the cannons, storm the walls
We will see this city fall
Show no mercy in the fight
The sky will burn with blood this night

Set Sail and conquer - On a quest to distant lands
Set Sail and conquer - Destiny is in our hands
To the heart of battle ride - The gods are on our side
We'll sail and conquer 'til we die

A reign of blood and slaughter
We show our foes no quarter
Taking their lives and watching them die
We leave our fears behind
Only treasure on our minds
For tonight we raise a hail
In death or victory

Fire the cannons, storm the walls
We will see this city fall
Show no mercy in the fight
The sky will burn with blood this night

Set Sail and conquer - On a quest to distant lands
Set Sail and conquer - Destiny is in our hands
To the heart of battle ride - The gods are on our side
We'll sail and conquer 'til we die

A dreaded curse - Is spoken of
By all men of the sea - An ancient tale
Of pirate's woe - And sailor's tragedy

A map was drawn - By grizzled men
Forgotten years ago - A chest of glory
And mortal sin - The none should ever know

And they searched and they searched
And they searched and they searched
For forbidden treasure old
And this curse, and this curse,
and this curse, and this curse
Will forever now be told

A pirate captain - Of many years
Had heard these whispers grim - But lust for treasure
And endless wealth - Had all but blinded him

He hired a crew - Of hardy men
To help him in his cause - They never knew
The danger of - This bounty's evil force

And they searched and they searched
And they searched and they searched
For forbidden treasure old
And this curse, and this curse,
and this curse, and this curse
Will forever now be told

Now stormy nights - When moon is full
Will herald in their call - A ghostly crew
Who loot and kill - 'til all before them fall
Now listen, lad - Remember this
When foul winds blow agale - Lest shadow come
And write your name - In adage to this tale

When I come back from a mighty quest
I have no need for sleep or rest
I head to a tavern for a drink
And get so drunk I cannot think
A wench by my side and a jug of mead
These are the things that I most need
So I sit back and sing this song
And drink and party all night long

Hey! Hey!
I want more wenches
Hey! Hey!
More wenches and mead
Hey! Hey!
I want more wenches
Lots of wenches is what I need

When I come back from a mighty quest
I have no need for sleep or rest

And drink and party all night long

Hey! Hey!

With a hi hi ho and a hi hi hey!
We're hoisting the flag to be free
We will steal the show, Jolly Rogers go
We are wolves of the sea

Don't try to run, it's all said and done
There's a treasure in sight
We are robbing you blind I hope you don't mind
We are taking it all tonight

Just walk away we will conquer it all
Pirates will stand and the loser will fall

With a hi hi ho and a hi hi hey
We're bound to be close to the sea
Our captain will stand on the bridge and sing
Pirates are all we can be

With a hi hi ho and a hi hi hey!
We're hoisting the flag to be free
We will steal the show, Jolly Rogers go
We are wolves of the sea

Down to the core we're coming for more
With a sword close at hand
We are scary and bold, with a chest full of gold
We get sea legs when sighting land

The hook of our captain is looking at you
There's no Peter Pan so what can you do

With a hi hi ho and a hi hi hey
We're bound to be close to the sea
Our captain will stand on the bridge and sing
Pirates are all we can be

We are wolves of the sea
We are wolves of the sea

Sailing the seven seas of metal
We thirst for blood, your ship is in our sights
Taste a broadside from our cannons of steel
Before our cutlasses of metal you shall kneel

We are Heavy Metal Pirates
We sail across the sky
In our battleships of cosmic steel
We're the terror up on high
We are Heavy Metal Pirates
Our cutlasses are true
So give us all your treasure
Or soon we'll come for you

The wind is in our sails, and fate is on our side
So raise the Jolly Roger and sail into the night
We're warriors of steel upon the Spanish Main
No quarter for the poseurs, we'll bring 'em death and pain

We are Heavy Metal Pirates
We sail across the sky
In our battleships of cosmic steel
We're the terror up on high
We are Heavy Metal Pirates
Our cutlasses are true
So give us all your treasure
Or soon we'll come for you

Go - the cold moonlight reflecting off your blade
So many centuries spent waiting for this day
Ride - across the seas beneath a blackened sail
Know that a painful death awaits us if we fail

Out of the darkness they came
With cannons a'raging and torches aflame
Slaying all poseurs who stand in their way

Black Sails at Midnight
You're dead by daylight
Black Sails at Midnight
Your fate - Too late

The time has come for you to face your darkest fears
Screams of agony are ringing in your ears
Die - a frenzied slaughter on the battlefield
Nowhere for you to run, tonight your fate is sealed

Out of the darkness they came
With cannons a'raging and torches aflame
Slaying all poseurs who stand in their way

Black Sails at Midnight
You're dead by daylight
Black Sails at Midnight
Your fate - Too late

Though you see me now a mere ghost of a man
I once had the heart of a lion
Commanded my ship between many a shore
The ol' Jolly Roger a-flyin

Mine was a name that struck fear into men
And regret into plenty of lasses
Oh, how I wish I could take back those days
As I stare at these empty beer-glasses

I think of the times past when I had it all
I toyed with men's wives and their daughters
And in my pursuit of this ill-gotten wealth
I stabbed and I slashed and I slaughtered.

And for what?
The men that I've fought
Are matched by the number of women I've bought
And for what?
I've killed and I've shot
And reddened the cold tears of children with blood
And If I could go back and make my amends
I'd make all those mistakes again
I'd kill every last one of those bastards, my friend

My ship was the last sight that many would see
As we narrowed the gap with our quarry
The sound of the cannons and splintering wood
Would herald our paths into glory

We seized all the bounty and scuppered the ship
Our hearts hadn't time for the wounded
I took my share and the crew got the rest
And on into port we then bounded

Life has many pleasures, and we had our fill
Of food and of wenches and beer
When we'd tired of the port or had drunken it dry
The time to set sail would come near

And for what?
We heeded no law
Made other men suffer so we could have more
And for what?
We lived every day
With the noose of the hangman a hair's breadth away
And If I could go back and make my amends
I'd make all those mistakes again
I'd kill every last one of those bastards, my friend

Oh I have seen wonders you'd never have dreamed,
And taken my fair share, I must say
Holds full of booty I happily seized
From crews who would not see a new day

Spanish gold came and went, gem stones got sold,
But I knew more lay on the horizon,
Yet the beer was too good and the gals were too sweet
And now in my old age it's gone

These memories were bought with the lives of good men
A price that I paid without scruple
So many souls suffered so I could get drunk
And swagger from brothel to brothel

And for what?
It's been many years
Yet the screams of the vanquished still ring in my ears
And for what?
I've blood on my hands
I wait for my place in the halls of the damned
And If I could go back and make my amends
I'd make all those mistakes again
I'd kill every last one of those bastards, my friend

Who's that short man what does he do?
He killed that monkey with his shoe!
Why that monkey? Why his boot?
'Cause he had a belly full of loot!

The monkey needs his damn revenge!
That poor creature we'll avenge!

Midget Saw, a deadly fate
Chopped up limbs become shark bait
Midget Saw, the pirate's code
It says that both your legs must go
Chopped to pieces
Ripped to shreds
You're gonna wish that you were dead!

Grab him by his manky hair
And strap him to that table there
This pirate's not gonna walk again
He's in for a world of nasty pain!

Slap that midget with an oar
Remove his legs with a saw!

Midget Saw, a deadly fate
Chopped up limbs become shark bait
Midget Saw, the pirate's code
It says that both your legs must go
Chopped to pieces
Ripped to shreds
You're gonna wish that you were dead!

Midget Saw, a deadly fate
Chopped up limbs become shark bait
Midget Saw, the pirate's code
It says that both your legs must go
Chopped to pieces
Ripped to shreds
You're gonna wish that you were dead!

It's 3 years to the very day,
since a pirate captain said to me,
hey lad come join our crew,
adventure and glory waits for you!

I took his words as gold,
and set sail for quests untold with a bottle of rum,
in my hand I dreamed of wealth and foreign lands!

Hey! you're banjaxed! Hey! you're screwed!
and death is coming for you!
trapped on an island lost at sea!
shipwrecked you'll cease to be!

Hey! you're banjaxed! Hey! you're screwed!
and death is coming for you!
trapped on an island lost at sea!
shipwrecked your destiny!

On the 16th night at sea,
in the depths of toil and misery,
we struck a hidden reef,
and our ship began to sink beneath,

I grabbed some drifting wood,
and held on as long as I could,
'til I landed on a desert isle,
now I'm stuck here 'til the day I die!

Hey! you're banjaxed! Hey! you're screwed!
and death is coming for you!
trapped on an island lost at sea!
shipwrecked you'll cease to be!

Hey! you're banjaxed! Hey! you're screwed!
and death is coming for you!
trapped on an island lost at sea!
shipwrecked your destiny!

Shipwrecked! Shipwrecked! Get drunk or die!
Shipwrecked! Shipwrecked! Get Drunk or die!

Hey! you're banjaxed! Hey! you're screwed!
and death is coming for you!
trapped on an island lost at sea!
shipwrecked you'll cease to be!

Hey! you're banjaxed! Hey! you're screwed!
and death is coming for you!
trapped on an island lost at sea!
shipwrecked your destiny!

Then hang up our coats (aye-aye!)
Until we sail again!

You are a pirate!

Yar har, wind at your back, lads,
Wherever you go!

Blue sky above and blue ocean below,
You are a pirate!
You are a pirate!

You are a pirate! Ya gobshite!"

The time for execution, a harrowing display
For treachery upon the seas has taken place this day
Your final hour has begun,
We've all agreed your end has come
We'll take your sword, we'll take your gun - it's time
For you to come undone
Be aware, what lies beneath
Razor sharp and pointy teeth
Walk the Plank!
With your life, you'll pay the price
Walk the Plank!
Boots of lead, your blood runs red
Walk the Plank!
Time to die, your end is nigh
Walk the Plank!
Descend into the black and don't come back
A nameless bay, in the mist
You have no right to exist
You've got the captain really pissed,
and so it's time you were dismissed
Give the line a little twist
And wrap the ropes around your wrist
Eyes to fill your soul with dread
The fury of the hammerhead
Walk the Plank!
With your life, you'll pay the price
Walk the Plank!
Boots of lead, your blood runs red
Walk the Plank!
Time to die, your end is nigh
Walk the Plank!
Descend into the black and don't come back
Be aware my friend, what lies beneath
Razor sharp and full of pointy teeth
Burning eyes to fill your soul right up with dread
The raging fury of the hammerhead
